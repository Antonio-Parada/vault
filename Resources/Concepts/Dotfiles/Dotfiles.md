# Dotfiles

Dotfiles are configuration files for various programs on Unix-like systems. The name comes from the convention of starting the filenames with a dot, which makes them hidden from normal view in file browsers.

## Management

*   **Version Control:** It is a best practice to manage dotfiles with Git to track changes, back them up, and easily set up new machines.
