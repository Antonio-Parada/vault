# Session Persistence

Session persistence is the practice of saving the state of your work environment so that it can be restored later, typically after a system reboot or when you intentionally close a session.

## Importance

For developers and power users who work with complex layouts of windows, panes, and applications, session persistence is crucial for productivity. It eliminates the need to manually recreate your workspace every time you start a new session.

## Tools for Session Persistence

*   **[[i3-resurrect]]**: For the i3 window manager.
*   **[[tmux-resurrect]]**: For the tmux terminal multiplexer.

By using these tools in combination, you can achieve a fully persistent workflow, from your window manager layout down to your terminal sessions.
