# Interlinking

Interlinking, also known as wikilinking, is a fundamental practice within this Obsidian vault to create a robust and interconnected knowledge graph. It involves creating internal links between related notes.

## Benefits of Interlinking:

*   **Enhanced Navigation:** Easily jump between related concepts and ideas.
*   **Contextual Understanding:** See how different pieces of information relate to each other.
*   **Knowledge Discovery:** Uncover new connections and insights as your vault grows.
*   **Improved Recall:** Strengthens memory by associating new information with existing knowledge.

## Best Practices:

*   **Relevant Connections:** Only link notes that are genuinely related.
*   **Contextual Links:** Ensure the link makes sense within the sentence or paragraph.
*   **Avoid Over-linking:** Don't link every single word; focus on key concepts.
*   **Use Aliases:** If a note has common aliases, consider adding them to the YAML frontmatter to make linking easier.
*   **Proactive Linking:** As you create new notes, actively think about how they connect to existing ones.
