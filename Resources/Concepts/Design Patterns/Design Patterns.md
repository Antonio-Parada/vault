# Design Patterns

Design Patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in software design. They are not ready-to-use code snippets, but rather templates that describe how to solve a problem in various situations. They provide a common vocabulary for developers to discuss solutions.

## Categories of Design Patterns

Design patterns are typically categorized into three main types:

1.  **Creational Patterns:** Deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.
    *   **Singleton:** Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
    *   **Factory Method:** Provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
    *   **Builder:** Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

2.  **Structural Patterns:** Deal with the composition of classes and objects.
    *   **Adapter:** Allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.
    *   **Decorator:** Attaches new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.
    *   **Facade:** Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.

3.  **Behavioral Patterns:** Deal with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
    *   **Observer:** Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
    *   **Strategy:** Defines a family of algorithms, puts each of them into a separate class, and makes their objects interchangeable.
    *   **Command:** Turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request.

## Benefits of Using Design Patterns

*   **Common Vocabulary:** Facilitates communication among developers.
*   **Proven Solutions:** Provides well-tested and proven approaches to common problems.
*   **Flexibility and Maintainability:** Leads to more flexible, robust, and maintainable code.
*   **Improved Code Structure:** Helps in organizing code in a logical and understandable way.

Design patterns can be implemented in virtually any object-oriented language:
