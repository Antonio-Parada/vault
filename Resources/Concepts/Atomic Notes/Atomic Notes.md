# Atomic Notes

Atomic notes are a core principle of effective knowledge management within this vault. Each note should ideally focus on a single, distinct concept, idea, or piece of information.

## Benefits of Atomic Notes:

*   **Clarity:** Easier to understand and digest a single concept.
*   **Interlinking:** Facilitates robust interlinking between related ideas.
*   **Reusability:** Individual concepts can be easily referenced and reused in multiple contexts.
*   **Discoverability:** Improves searchability and navigability within the vault.

## Best Practices:

*   **Single Idea:** Focus on one main idea per note.
*   **Conciseness:** Be as concise as possible while retaining clarity.
*   **Self-Contained:** The note should be understandable on its own, even if it links to other notes.
*   **Link Extensively:** Use [[wikilinks]] to connect to related atomic notes, building a rich knowledge graph.
