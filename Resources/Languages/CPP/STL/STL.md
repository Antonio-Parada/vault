# C++ Standard Template Library (STL)

The Standard Template Library (STL) is a software library for the C++ programming language that influenced many parts of the C++ Standard Library. It provides four components called algorithms, containers, functions, and iterators.

## Core Components

1.  **Containers:** Collections of objects or primitive types. Examples include:
    *   `std::vector`: A dynamic array.
    *   `std::list`: A doubly-linked list.
    *   `std::map`: A sorted associative array (key-value pairs).
    *   `std::unordered_map`: A hashed associative array.
    *   `std::set`: A sorted collection of unique items.

2.  **Algorithms:** A collection of functions for searching, sorting, counting, and manipulating sequences and their elements.
    *   `std::sort`
    *   `std::find`
    *   `std::copy`

3.  **Iterators:** Objects that can be thought of as pointers to elements in a container. They provide a way to access container elements.

4.  **Functors (Function Objects):** Objects that can be treated as functions, often by overloading the `()` operator.
