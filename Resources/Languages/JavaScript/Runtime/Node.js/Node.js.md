# Node.js

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.

## Key Features

*   **Asynchronous and Event-Driven:** Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient.
*   **NPM (Node Package Manager):** Node.js has a rich ecosystem of open-source libraries and packages available through npm.
*   **Single-Threaded:** Node.js operates on a single thread, using non-blocking I/O calls to support concurrency.

## Use Cases

*   Real-time applications like chat servers and streaming services.
*   Command-line tools and scripts.
