# JavaScript Basic Syntax

JavaScript is a high-level, dynamically-typed language.

## Variables
Variables can be declared using `var`, `let`, or `const`.

```javascript
var oldVariable = "(can be re-declared and updated)";
let newVariable = "(can be updated, block-scoped)";
const constantVariable = "(cannot be updated or re-declared, block-scoped)";
```

## Data Types
JavaScript has several primitive types:
*   `string`
*   `number` (for both integers and floating-point numbers)
*   `boolean`
*   `null`
*   `undefined`
*   `symbol`

And one complex type:
*   `object`

## Comments

```javascript
// Single-line comment

/*
Multi-line comment
*/
```
