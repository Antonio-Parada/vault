# .NET Base Class Library (BCL)

The Base Class Library (BCL) is a standard library of types, interfaces, and classes that provide the foundation for the .NET Framework (including C#). It provides a wide range of common functionalities and is the core of the .NET development platform.

## Key Namespaces

The BCL is organized into namespaces. Some of the most fundamental ones include:

*   `System`: Contains fundamental classes and base classes that define commonly-used value and reference data types, events and event handlers, interfaces, attributes, and processing exceptions.
*   `System.Collections.Generic`: Contains interfaces and classes that define generic collections, such as `List<T>` and `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>`.
*   `System.IO`: Contains types that allow for synchronous and asynchronous reading and writing on data streams and files.
*   `System.Linq`: Provides classes and interfaces that support queries that use Language-Integrated Query (LINQ).
*   `System.Net.Http`: Provides a class for sending HTTP requests and receiving HTTP responses from a resource identified by a URI.
*   `System.Threading.Tasks`: Provides types that simplify the work of writing concurrent and asynchronous code.
