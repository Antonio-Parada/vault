# C# Projects and Assemblies

In the .NET ecosystem, code is organized into projects, and the output of a project is an assembly.

## Projects (`.csproj`)
A project is the basic unit of compilation. It is defined by a `.csproj` file, which is an XML file that contains all the information needed to build the project, including:
*   Source files to include
*   Dependencies on other projects or NuGet packages
*   The target framework (e.g., .NET 6.0)
*   The output type (e.g., executable, library)

## Solutions (`.sln`)
A solution is a container for one or more projects. It is defined by a `.sln` file and is used to manage and build multiple related projects together.

## Assemblies
An assembly is the compiled output of a C# project. It is the fundamental unit of deployment, versioning, and security in .NET. An assembly can be either:

*   An **executable file (`.exe`)**
*   A **dynamic-link library (`.dll`)**

Assemblies contain the compiled code (in a format called Intermediate Language or IL) and metadata about the types, methods, and other resources within the code.
