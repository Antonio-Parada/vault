# NumPy

NumPy (Numerical Python) is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object, and tools for working with these arrays.

## Key Features

*   **`ndarray`:** A powerful N-dimensional array object.
*   **Broadcasting:** A mechanism that allows NumPy to work with arrays of different shapes during arithmetic operations.
*   **Vectorization:** Applying operations to entire arrays rather than looping over individual elements.
*   **Mathematical Functions:** A large library of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

## Basic Usage

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a NumPy array
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])

# Perform a vectorized operation
b = a * 2  # b is now array([2, 4, 6])
```
