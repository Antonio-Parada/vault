# Software Development

This is a central area of focus, encompassing a wide range of languages, ecosystems, and practices.

## Languages & Ecosystems

*   **Python:** Used for scripting, AI/ML (gemini_chat.py), and general development.
*   **JavaScript/Node.js:** Indicated by `.npm` caches and web projects.
*   **C/C++:** Projects managed within `CLionProjects`.
*   **.NET:** Presence of the `.dotnet` directory.

## Tools & Practices

*   **Editors:** Fluent in both VS Code (`.vscode`) and Neovim (`.config/nvim`), indicating an appreciation for both full-featured IDEs and efficient, terminal-based editors.
*   **Version Control:** Git is a core part of the workflow.
*   **Web Development:** Experience with web frameworks and tools, as seen in the `roller-coaster-tycoon-web` project.
*   **Web Testing/Automation:** Use of Playwright (`.cache/ms-playwright`).
