# Personal Knowledge Vault: A Personal Knowledge Management System

This repository houses my personal knowledge management (PKM) system, built using Obsidian.md. It serves as a demonstration of my approach to continuous learning, knowledge organization, and deep technical expertise.

## Project Scope

The primary goal of this vault is to act as a "second brain," capturing and connecting information across various technical domains. It is a living project that evolves as I explore new technologies and deepen my understanding of existing ones. For a potential employer, it showcases not just what I know, but *how* I structure and utilize knowledge.

## Organization: The PARA Method

The vault is organized using the **PARA Method** (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archive), a system designed for actionable knowledge management:

*   **`/Projects`**: Contains notes and documentation for specific, time-bound endeavors with clear goals. This is what I am actively working on.
*   **`/Areas`**: Holds information related to ongoing areas of responsibility and sustained interest. These are the domains I am committed to maintaining.
*   **`/Resources`**: A library of evergreen notes on specific topics, tools, languages, and concepts. This forms the foundational knowledge base.
*   **`/Archive`**: A repository for completed projects and inactive areas, retained for future reference.

This structure ensures that information is organized by its actionability, making it easy to distinguish between active work, long-term interests, and reference material.

## Key Knowledge Areas

This vault is a direct reflection of my technical interests and expertise. Key areas documented include:

*   **Software Development:** Deep dives into programming languages (Python, C++, C#, JavaScript), design patterns, API design, and development methodologies.
*   **AI & LLMs:** Exploration of Large Language Models like Gemini, AI-powered automation, and machine learning frameworks.
*   **Cybersecurity:** Notes on penetration testing tools (Metasploit), security concepts, and ethical hacking practices.
*   **Linux Customization & DevOps:** Extensive documentation on creating efficient, keyboard-driven Linux environments (i3, Neovim), dotfiles management, and DevOps concepts like containerization with Docker.

By navigating this vault, you can gain insight into my thought processes, my ability to learn and synthesize complex information, and my commitment to organized, high-quality work.
